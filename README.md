# Ferrum

This project is me exploring how to bring some of Ray to Rust and then build an RL framework around it.

## Goals

- [ ] Clean API for Ray-like behavior 
- [ ] Borrow insights from the SkyRL architecture 
- [ ] Identify components where Rust makes sense (inference engine, environment, generator)
- [ ] Reimplement each
- [ ] Measure performance gains
- [ ] Explore new capabilities!

### Ideas
- [ ] Build RL framework architecture around streaming instead of batching
