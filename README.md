A high-performance RL framework

## Architecture

For a high-level overview of Ferrum's design and core concepts, see [Archtecture Overview](design/architecture.md)

## Goals

- [ ] Learn as much as I can from other libraries like SkyRL
- [ ] Design APIs (including errors) first so usage is intuitive
- [ ] Keep resource utilization as close to 100% as we can
- [ ] Explore new capabilities!
