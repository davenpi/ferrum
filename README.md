# Ferrum

**High-performance reinforcement learning training framework**

This project is me exploring how we can use Rust to rewrite some parts of the excellent SkyRL (pure Python) to make it even more permformant.

## Goals

- [ ] Borrow insights from the SkyRL architecture 
- [ ] Identify components where Rust makes sense (inference engine, environment, generator)
- [ ] Reimplement each
- [ ] Measure performance gains
- [ ] Explore new capabilities!

### Grail
- [ ] Rebuild architecture around streaming instead of batching
